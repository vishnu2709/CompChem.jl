# Quantum Phoenix

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vishnu2709/CompChem.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vishnu2709/CompChem.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is a software package for performing computational chemistry calculations. Currently we can do restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock using STO-NG, 6-31G, 6-31G(d,p) and cc-pVDZ basis sets. I have a lot of features that I'm working on adding, so stay tuned for future versions.
